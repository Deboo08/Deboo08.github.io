Basketball is the best friend of my life. For me, basketball has given me something that other people and things cannot provide in my life. Basketball is not only a way for me to relax and make friends, but it has also become a way of life for me. I have been playing basketball for ten years. It has caused me to sprain my ankles several times and injure my knees multiple times, but it still cannot hinder my love for it.


## Guitar && Sing

Guitar and singing are also important friends in my life. I have tried to create my own songs and have performed on stage several times in high school and college. For me, they are an indispensable part of my life.

## Games

My favorite mobile game is "Legends of the Three Kingdoms." It is a game that encompasses historical allusions, historical knowledge, literary knowledge, and fun. I really enjoy it. Despite the unattractive behavior of its development company, it doesn't prevent it from being a great game.


## Boxing && Chinese Kung Fu
